# Possible journals to submit
Nicolas mentioned that there would be a special issue of RSA, which we might submit to.
1. JAP or Advance in Applied Probability
2. Combinatorics, Probability and Computing
3. Journal of Complexity?

I will try to use Stein's method to obtain normal approximation and Poisson approximation results, thus this note hopefully could be submitted to some journals.
